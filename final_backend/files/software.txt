Software project scheduling distributes estimated effort across the planned project duration by allocating the effort to specific tasks During early stages of project planning, a macroscopic schedule is developed identifying all major process framework activities and the product functions to which they apply Later, each task is refined into a detailed schedule where specific software tasks are identified and scheduled Scheduling for projects can be viewed from two different perspectives In the first view, an end-date for release of a computer-based system has already been established and fixed The software organization is constrained to distribute effort within the prescribed time frame In the second view, assume that rough chronological bounds have been discussed but that the end-date is set by the software engineering organization Effort is distributed to make best use of resources and an end-date is defined after careful analysis of the software
